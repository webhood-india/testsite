# The CSS Folder

This folder contains custom CSS files for your site. These files correspond to the ones found in the **CSS** section of the **Page Code** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89579857/184645988-6d4ee6d3-34ab-45bc-b914-5779a7de0cad.png) tab in the Velo sidebar.

Many [Wix Editor Elements](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/$w) have specially defined class names that you can use to style them. You can also create custom class names to use in your CSS code. To learn about supported elements and their class names, see the [Velo API Reference](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/$w/styling-elements-with-css?branch=custom-css-beta).

Currently, you can only add 1 file to this folder, called `global.css`. The styles defined in this file are applied to all the pages on your site.
